#This registry type will prefix-match the path provided in the url option. This means you can provide multiple credentials to the same host, which can be used to access distinct paths. However, if you don't have multiple registries on the same host, we recommend that you omit the path from the url, so that all paths to the registry will receive credentials.

registries:
  github-hex-org:
    type: hex-organization
    organization: github
    key: ${{secrets.MY_HEX_ORGANIZATION_KEY}}
